Aim: To explore hashdeep tool in kali linux for generating, matching and
auditing hash of files.

Theory:
hashdeep is a set of tools to compute MD5, SHA1, SHA256, tiger and whirlpool hashsums of arbitrary number of files recursively.
The main hashdeep features are:
It can compare those hashsums with a list of known hashes;
The tools can display those that match the list or those that does not match;
It can display a time estimation when processing large files.
It can do piecewise hashing (hash input files in arbitrary sized blocks).
This package is useful in forensics investigations.
Installation: sudo apt-get install hashdeep

Lab Outcome Attainment: LO2
1.To check the version of Hashdeep:
hashdeep -V
2. To display help about hashdeep:
hashdeep -h or hashdeep -hh
3. To display the manual page of hashdeep:
man hashdeep
4. To display the manual page of any specific hash algorithm supported
by hashdeep:
man md5deep
By default, hashdeep generates MD5 n SHA256 hash values.
5. To hash a file:
hashdeep filename
6. If you don’t want to display the full path of file in output hash
record:
hashdeep -b filename
7. To supress any error messages:
hashdeep -s filename
8. To apply multiple hash algorithms than default:
hashdeep -c md5,sha1,sha256,tiger filename
9. To hash multiple files (say all text files) using md5:
hashdeep -c md5 *.txt
10. To hash multiple files (say all text files) using md5 and sha1:
hashdeep -c md5,sha1 *.txt 
11. Hashing block of files:
hashdeep -c md5 -p 100 example.txt
12. To recursively calculate hash (all files and subdirectories in a
specified directory):
hashdeep c md5 -r /home/shachi/myfiles
13. To redirect the output of md5 hash of files to another file:
md5deep *.txt>hashset.txt
hashdeep *.txt>hashtext1.txt
Check the content of output filecat hashset.txt
cat hashset1.txt
14. To display output in matching mode:
md5deep -m hashset.txt *
hashdeep -m -k hashset1.txt *
15. To supress unwanted system msgs/error:
md5deep -m hashset.txt *
hashdeep -s -m hashset1.txt *
No output is displayed if there is no matching hashed file is found.
16. To display all files which are negatively matching use -x option:
Md5deep -s -x hashset.txt *
hashdeep -s -x hashset1.txt *
Forensic auditing can be done using hashdeep tool which means a
check to determine if any files in the system are changed due to malware
or any normal system operation like update patching.
17. To audit, first create a hashset file and then audit it against the files
to be checked if they are modified.
hashdeep -c md5,sha1,sha256 -r /home/shachi/myfiles>hashset1.txt
hashdeep -a -r -k hashset1.txt /home/shachi/myfiles
18. Add new file to the directory and audit. It fails.
touch /home/shachi/myfiles/newfile.txt
hashdeep -a -r -k hashset1.txt /home/shachi/myfiles
19. To get where it failed use the command with -v option
hashdeep -v -a -r -k hashset1.txt /home/shachi/myfiles
20. Move one of the files to another directory and audit n see output:
mv /home/shachi/myfiles/example.txt /tmp
hashdeep -v -a -r -k hashset1.txt /home/shachi/myfiles
21. Rename one of the files and audit n see the output
mv /home/shachi/myfiles/shachi.txt /home/shachi/myfiles/shachi.bak
hashdeep -v -a -r -k hashset1.txt /home/shachi/myfiles
22. For verbose output of audit
hashdeep -vv -a -r -k hashset1.txt /home/shachi/myfiles
hashdeep -vvv -a -r -k hashset1.txt /home/shachi/myfiles


A.first file hashing - hashdeep filename
second file only md5 - hashdeep -c md5 filename 
different length for different hashdeep commands
to put hashdeep in a file write: hashdeep file.txt>hashset.txt(file name)
to put all hashes in a file write: hashdeep *>hashall.txt(file name)
B.to audit write: hashdeep -a -r -k hashset.txt file.txt


Traceroute:
traceroute command in Linux prints the route that a packet takes to reach the host. This command is useful when you want to know about the route and about all the hops that a packet takes.
eg: traceroute www.google.com

Nikto:Nikto is an open-source web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items. You can use Nikto with any web servers like Apache, Nginx, IHS, OHS, Litespeed, and so on. Nikto can check for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Items and plugins scanned by Nikto are frequently updated and can be automatically updated.
Installation: sudo apt-get install nikto
eg: nikto -h 128.199.222.244 

Dmitry:Dmitry is a free and open-source tool available on GitHub. The tool is used for information gathering. You can download the tool and install in your Kali Linux. Dmitry stands for DeepMagic Information Gathering Tool. It’s a command-line tool Using Dmitry tool You can collect information about the target, this information can be used for social engineering attacks. It can be used to gather a number of valuable pieces of information

Usages of Dmitry Tool :
Dmitry Tool can be used to search subdomains of the target.
Dmitry Tool can be used to find open ports of the target system.
Dmitry Tool can be used to perform TCP scan.
Dmitry Tool can be used with netcraft service to get the target information such as operating system, web server details, web host details, hosting service details, etc.
Dmitry Tool can be used with whois service to get the target information such as registered domain, name, address, the contact information of the person who registered it.
Dmitry Tool can be used to get email addresses that are associated with the domain of the target.
