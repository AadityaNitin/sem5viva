LAB ASSIGNMENT No. 11
Aim: Installing snort, configuring it in Intrusion Detection mode and writing rules 
for detecting pinging activity.
Lab Outcome Attained: LO6
Theory:
Steps to Install snort and configure it in Intrusion Detection Mode.
1. Check the name of the interface using command ifconfig.
2. Install snort in ubuntu machine using command sudo apt-get install snort
3. While installing the snort, name of the interface will be asked on which snort 
is supposed to listen. Enter the interface name observed in step 1.
4. Run the command sudo gedit /etc/snort/snort.conf . This opens snort 
configuration file.
5. Make following changes to configuration file.
a. ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.44.0/24 (in section 1)
6. Open new terminal. Open ftp.rule file in it by typing the command 
sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/ftp.rules (optional)
7. Open new terminal and type the command sudo snort -T -c 
/etc/snort/snort.conf -i ens33 to validate that all rules are there.
We use the 
-T flag to test the configuration file, 
-c flag to tell Snort which configuration file to use, and 
-i to specify the interface that Snort will listen on.
8. Type the command sudo snort -A console -q -u snort -g snort -c 
/etc/snort/snort.conf -i ens33 (to start snort in NIDS mode)
We use the 
-A console The ‘console’ option prints fast mode alerts to stdout 
-q Quiet mode. Don’t show banner and status report. 
-u snort Run Snort as the following user after startup 
-g snort Run Snort as the following group after startup 
-c /etc/snort/snort.conf The path to our snort.conf file 
-i ens33 The interface to listen on (change to your interface if different)
9. Now go to kali linux machine.
10. Type command nmap 192.168.44.128 on it to start port scanning of ubuntu 
machine and observe the output in terminal where snort is started in detection 
environment.
When you execute this command, you will not initially see any output. Snort 
is running, and is processing all packets that arrive on eth0 (or whichever 
interface you specified with the -i flag). Snort compares each packet to the 
rules it has loaded (in this case our single ICMP Ping rule), and will then print 
an alert to the console when a packet matches our rule.
11.Then try pinging ubuntu machine by typing the command ping 
192.168.44.128 and observe the output in terminal where snort is started in 
detection mode.
12. Adding rule for detecting ping activity performed by another machine:
a. In ubuntu machine, type the following command to create a file called 
local.rules : sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
b. Write the following rule in it: alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET 
any (msg:"ICMP test detected"; GID:1; sid:10000001; rev:001; 
classtype:icmp-event;)
c. Save the local.rules file.
d. Comment the following lines in configuration file (snort.conf) of snort: 
icmp.rules and icmp-info.rules
e. Add the local.rules file in section 7 of configuration file of snort by 
writing: include $RULE_PATH local.rules
f. Validate the changes made in snort.conf file by writing the command 
in terminal: sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i ens33
g. Set the snort in Intrusion Detection Mode by typing the command: sudo 
snort -A console -q -u snort -g snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i ens33
h. Now from kali machine ping the ubuntu machine and see the alert 
generated.
i. Observe the difference between the alerts generated when icmp.rules 
and icmp-info.rules are used and when local.rules is used to detect the 
ping activity.
