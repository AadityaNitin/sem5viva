Denial of Service Attack:
A denial of service (DoS) event is a cyber attack in which hackers or 
cybercriminals seek to make a host machine, online service or network resource 
unavailable to its intended users.
Different types of Denial of Service Attacks: Syn flood, Ping (ICMP) flood, UDP 
flood, etc.
Hping3 for performing DOS attack

# hping3 -c 15000 -d 120 -S -w 64 -p 80 --flood --rand-source 192.168.1.159
ICMP flood using hping3:
An Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood attack, also known as a Ping 
flood attack, is a common Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack in which an attacker 
attempts to overwhelm a targeted device with ICMP echo-requests (pings). 
Normally, ICMP echo-request and echo-reply messages are used to ping a 
network device in order to diagnose the health and connectivity of the device 
and the connection between the sender and the device. By flooding the target 
with request packets, the network is forced to respond with an equal number of 
reply packets. This causes the target to become inaccessible to normal traffic.
